Paddlers included: Gibbi, Paul, Darren, Sam, Tom, Joe, Alan, Steve, Andy and me. We headed to the Leven which was on a low. As newbies, Darren and I weren't up to the whole Leven, so we got in near Newby Bridge below the graveyard with Gibbi and Paul to do some skills work. The rest of the group got in higher up to run the more adventurous section. We practised ferry gliding, s-turns and eddying out.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](leven.png){width=502}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere were number of paddlers out, including Liverpool canoe club, and a group of open whitewater canoes. After a bit of lunch we portaged back up-river to run the section again, this time picking our own way though the rocks and into eddys. We carried on to Backbarrow, getting out just before Backbarrow bridge. I was quite glad we weren't running that, although I'm sure the more advanced group enjoyed it. We caught up with the others at the Cafe Ambio car park. Turns out whilst we'd been working hard, they'd been having a leisurely cuppa! It was great to have the opportunity to practise skills with Paul and Gibbi, even though my brain hurts a bit now! Thanks for a great day paddling.\n",
