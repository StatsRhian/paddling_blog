It was a cold start when Mandy, Steve, Darren, Dexter, Paul and I met outside the hut. Halton was on a (high) low so we headed over to the Mill and were later joined by Alan and Steve. We played at the top for a while, practising sweep strokes until we were dizzy and then slowly picked our way down the river. Around midday the sun was just starting to peek over the trees and provided some welcome warm sunshine. Beckie and Simon also popped down for a chat and some advice from the bank. We only did one run today, but still had a good three hours of play and practice. Skills practised included Paul's elusive \"electric ferry glide\" ( you'll have to ask him...) Another great day on the river and we've definitely earned our dinner and pints tonight.\n",
