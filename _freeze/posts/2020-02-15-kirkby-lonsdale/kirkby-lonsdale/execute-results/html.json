Waters faster than I would choose! Swam after trying to follow Simon down a feature. Alec looked after me. Had another hairy moment later down the river, but stayed upright. Practiced ferry gliding under the bridge. Stopped for a pint at the Fenwick.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](kirkby-lonsdale.png){width=568}\n:::\n:::\n",
