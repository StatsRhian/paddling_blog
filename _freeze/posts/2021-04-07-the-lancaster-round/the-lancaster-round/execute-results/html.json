Top company and excellent brews and burgers back at Glasson - what's not to like about the Lancaster Loop? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2021-04-07-lancaster-round.jpg){width=952}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI didn't find the distance too challenging, and felt OK the day after. I struggled with entry and exit on canal side. Something to practice. I coped surprisingly well with the headwind on the final section.\n\n\n",
