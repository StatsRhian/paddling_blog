Blue sky, warm sun, gentle breeze and great views right round from Barrow, of the Lakeland hills to Ingleborough. Rounded Stone Jetty in the calm, a snack on the beach at the Midland Hotel and round back Stone Jetty against the tide. A final play around Bare Bay in the tide. 14 very happy, tired paddlers. \n\nI did an out and back with Simon and Arne in sea boats. I felt a little uncomfortable going out into the open sea without \"formal\" coaching. Something to practice! Lesson learnt - always take PLB / VHF. I didn't bother as I planned to stay with the large coastal group. We ended up splitting and a small group paddled further into the Bay. Always take it - just in case!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2021-04-10-morecambe.jpg){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n",
