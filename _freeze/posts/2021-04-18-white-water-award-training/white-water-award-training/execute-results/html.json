We discussed water features (at a mini level), leadership, decision making and equipment. We ran the river twice, once re-grouping at each eddy, and once in one run. I enjoyed picking the route down and the reccee before we ran features made the run much more pleasant. I was more confident having seen the upcoming features in advance and from above. It always amazes me how different features look on the river level!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2021-04-18-paul.jpg){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n",
