Swell that felt lumpy to paddle on day one became a spot for practising rolls and rescues, rock hopping gaps which felt a tight squeeze seemed to get bigger through the week and anxieties of open water crossings transformed into a quiet confidence.\nPersonal highlights for me were our camping spot on the Isle of Eigg circumnavigation, watching a pair of Scottish eagles play in the wind and taking the local kids of Muck out for an evening paddle.\nA massive thanks to Mike, Mac, Mike and Marie for their coaching and support and all the other paddlers for their lovely company!\nPhotos: https://photos.app.goo.gl/GfPnkH3AVtdowE5g6\n\n\n\n",
