Saturday (0.7m) was a good confidence builder for me. Chose a line for Amy to follow through the rapids.\nOn Sunday level was a little more challenging (1m). I didn't feel I was paddling as well, maybe tiredness but it was sloppy.Not using sweep strokes, not paddling aggressively. Might be worth considering a slightly smaller boat at some point?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](halton.jpg){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n> Well what a great weekend of paddling, 6/7th November on Halton rapids. The storms of Saturday put few people off and it was encouraging to see people coming on strongly. A very pleasant river level. How things changed overnight......the river was high Sunday morning so we delayed the start until 12. Still a big flow but wow, how well did people take to it. We are building up a promising group of paddlers.\n\n\n",
