First Saturday trip of 2020. Due to covid we were in groups of 6. I was with Gibbi, Colin, Rich, Michelle & Alis. We paddled up to the lower weir at Halton, Gibbi telling us about the Lune as we paddles. At Halton, we played in the tongue of water coming off the weir, practicing ferry gliding. We ate lunch on the battlement, and used the portage as an excuse to run down the middle of the weir. I forgot to smile - very dangerous. After lunch we kept playing in the flow, doing S-turns and ferries. Paul cycled up to have a chat. We paddled back down to the clubhouse, using our paddles as sails and making the most of the northerly winds. Gibbi: Colin and myself combined our groups into a six with Michelle, Alice, Richard and Rhi. A fine, warm day with a breeze blowing downstream and therefore into our faces as we casually paddled up to the lower weir at Halton. A short play in the moving water before taking lunch on the baffle. Sliding into the water upstream of the weir and paddling down through the tongue was achieved without incident followed by an hour of gentle skills practice in the moving water as can be seen in the pics. Well done all. Colin and I were quite impressed with your enthusiasm and progress. With the wind behind us it was a tiring paddle back to the hut. All now wearing spraydecks confidently after passing capsize tests. Another group with Paul, 3 youngsters and Wendy did the same trip
