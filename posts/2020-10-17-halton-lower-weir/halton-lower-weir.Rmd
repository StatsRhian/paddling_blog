Saturday, 17th October and another grand paddling session at Halton lower weir. Everyone very well organised again and away from the hut by 9.30. Some parking problems as it was a much nicer day. May solve that for next week. 3 groups led by Simon,Paul B and Colin with Gibbi and Paul J mingled among them. Much lower water level therefore we could get closer to the weir. Basic skills,river techniques a chance to go up towards the rapids and to run the weir. Much variety punctuated by a short lunch stop,a couple of soakings but a happy bunch were clear of the hut by 2.40pm and it had all gone rather well. Transport unshared and 2 daughters of non-paddling mums dropped at and picked up from the venue.
Also could to see multi-activity use of the site what with the Fire Brigade practising rescue skills and 6 female paddle boarders/open water swimmers. Fishermen not to be seenðŸ™‚
Same time and place next week with some rain to come this week.
