Club paddlers were on the river yesterday at a slightly higher level than previous weeks. Much enjoyed and nice to see our 2 youngest paddlers out bursting with enthusiasm. A bit of a Xmas paddle... it was nice to have a bit of a "socialise " at the end with a variety of beverages and Christmasy food.
