A 5am alarm, six degrees below freezing, not-quite dawn start from Glasson, the Coniston Fells and Ingleborough, portages up Skerton weir, 60-odd feet up from the Lune to the Lancaster Canal, Rennie's aqueduct, monuments and a castle, multiple bridges and a wonky house, 6 sets of locks (unless you find the cheeky troglodyte bypass option!) a rather amorous cob swan with a strong desire to "integrate", sunshine, blue sky and an unexpected, fierce headwind for the last 6 of 27kms... Top company and excellent brews and burgers back at Glasson - what's not to like about the Lancaster Loop?

I didn't find the distance too challenging, and felt OK the day after. I struggled with entry and exit on canal side. Something to practice. I coped surprisingly well with the headwind on the final section.
