Paddle on the beautiful Morecambe Bay from the Town Hall slipway. Blue sky, warm sun, gentle breeze and great views right round from Barrow, of the Lakeland hills to Ingleborough. Rounded Stone Jetty in the calm, a snack on the beach at the Midland Hotel and round back Stone Jetty against the tide. A final play around Bare Bay in the tide. 14 very happy, tired paddlers. 

I did an out and back with Simon and Arne in sea boats. I felt a little uncomfortable going out into the open sea without "formal" coaching. Something to practice! Lesson learnt - always take PLB / VHF. I didn't bother as I planned to stay with the large coastal group. We ended up splitting and a small group paddled further into the Bay. Always take it - just in case!
