WW Award training led by Paul Simpson. We discussed water features (at a mini level), leadership, decision making and equipment. We ran the river twice, once re-grouping at each eddy, and once in one run. I enjoyed picking the route down and the reccee before we ran features made the run much more pleasant. I was more confident having seen the upcoming features in advance and from above. It always amazes me how different features look on the river level!
