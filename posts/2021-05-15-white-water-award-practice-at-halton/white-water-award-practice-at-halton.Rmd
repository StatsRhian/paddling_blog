The fishermen opened up Halton Rapids to kayakers today and we made good use of it. We were on the water for around 4 hours, working toward the white water award. The group doing the WWA were myself, Arne, Paul Jackson, Simon Murby and Adam, led by Paul Simpson & Dave Horn. This time we focused less on group skills and features and more on skills. We spent lots of time ferry gliding (forwards and backwards) and practising braces.

I had one swim coming past the final baffle, I tried to high brace on a wave, missed and capsized. Not the best swim as I hit myself in the face with the paddle giving my self a nose bleed and got jammed on the shallow slabs by my boat and had to let it go down river. In hindsight I could have probably pushed myself back upright off the bottom and saved myself a swim. Aside from that it was a great day, with 2 other LDCC groups out. 

A good reminder that I definitely need more low and high brace practice - something for Thursday nights on the flat water.
