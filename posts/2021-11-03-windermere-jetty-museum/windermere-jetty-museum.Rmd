14 paddlers met at the Windermere Jetty Museum for a coffee and cake. 
We split into two groups of seven, and had a chatty paddle up the east side of Windermere. After a lunch at Waterhead, we paddled across the top and down the west side, doing a quick lap of Bell Island before getting back in time to look around the museum.
